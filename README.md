## Project 8: Library App Built Using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML

## Description: 
Welcome to my eighth web development project! This is part of my coursework in The Odin Project, a free, open-source curriculum to learn fullstack web development! 

This project was built in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML! 

The task for this project was to build a small Library app. I decided to expand this just for fun! I hope you enjoy!
